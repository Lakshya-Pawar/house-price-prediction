## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. The objective is to build a regression model to estimate house prices.

## Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed datasets to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created and modified features for better model performance.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables, and scaled features, and split data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Building**: Trained regression models (e.g., Linear regression, Random Forest regression).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11-3.12
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Files
- `data_description.txt`: Text file describing the features of the house price prediction datasets.
- `train.ipynb`: Main jupyter notebook for data analysis and preprocessing.
- `test.ipynb`: jupyter notebook for data cleaning of the test dataset.
- `formulatedtest.csv`: Prepared test dataset for house price prediction.
- `output.csv`: Dataset containing predicted final house prices.
